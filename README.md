# Face Expression Recognizer

Face Expression Recognizer is an application which uses custom machine learning algorithms trained for analysing video and image data.
It's main goal is to detect and classify human face expressions.

The project is the result of work done by members of the Czarna Magia AI Student Club.

## Demo

The project is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. Please, feel free to check out our
[live demo app on Gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jlynxdev/face-expression-recognizer)!

## Dataset

The project's AI models have been trained on the dataset which comes from the
[Facial Expression Recognition Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview).

## Tech Stack

- Python => 3.11
- PyTorch (`torch` and `torchvision`)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Weights & Biases
